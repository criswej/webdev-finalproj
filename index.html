    <p>Hello! Welcome to my page of Favorite Things. It's an eclectic collection which is sure to titillate. Since "curation" is a really hot buzzword right now, I'll take this opportunity to say that I've "curated" this collection. What does that actually mean? I leave it for the Reader to decide. Anywho, I hope this page hearkens back to the Angelfire pages of yore, but not too much, but just a teensy bit.</p>
